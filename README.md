## Technical details

This project extensively relies on Redux for state management. The code follows the lecture "A Real world application." of unit 3. The aim of the project is to showcase the "separation of concerns" using middleware to do XHR requests. Ideally React components should be as pure as possible and feasible. Use of middleware helps achieve this and react component remain as stateless as possible.
